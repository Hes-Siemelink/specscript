# Core concepts in SpecScript

## Language

These topics define the basic infrastructure of SpecScript:

* [SpecScript Yaml Scripts](SpecScript%20Yaml%20Scripts.spec.md)
* [SpecScript Markdown Documents](SpecScript%20Markdown%20Documents.spec.md)
* [Variables](Variables.spec.md)
* [Eval syntax](Eval%20syntax.spec.md)
* [Organizing SpecScript files in directories](Organizing%20SpecScript%20files%20in%20directories.spec.md)

## Core library

To create a useful SpecScript script, you will need some practical commands that actually do something.

* [Command reference](../commands) contains the overview and documentation of the built-in commands.

## Documentation

SpecScript is ideally developed by writing the documentation and tests first. You can embed SpecScript snippets
in [Markdown documents](SpecScript%20Markdown%20Documents.spec.md) and define the unit tests as part of the spec.
