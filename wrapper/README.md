# SpecScript Wrapper

This directory contains a wrapper script for SpecScript so you don't need to build it.

## Running SpecScript

Run SpecScript by invoking the wrapper script:

    ./cli

The wrapper script will download the published version of SpecScript specified
in [.SpecScript/wrapper.conf](.SpecScript/wrapper.conf) and run it.

## Copy the wrapper

You can use the wrapper script in your SpecScript project by copying the following files:

    .SpecScript/wrapper.conf
    cli

## SpecScript versions

For the latest versions, check the [SpecScript Releases](https://github.com/Hes-Siemelink/specscript/releases) page on
GitHub.
